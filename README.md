# Scse-Calendar

Description - 
-----------------------------------------
This app has been developed for an Assignment of Android Club. It has two seperate one for students and other one for admin(faculty)
In the Admin/Faculty login teachers can upload a pdf file of the calendar of events. Then our app uses the pdf box ibrary to fetch the
data from the pdf uploaded and after doing some processing of data like seperation of dates and events names data will be stored
in a firebase database with date as a key and event name as its value. 
Similarly as we are using the realtime firebase database so the changes will be reflected or updated over all the devices using the application.
In student login students can see all the events which will be loaded from the online db and can also filer the evenst datewise/monthwise
for easy access.
